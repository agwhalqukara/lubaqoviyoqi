A studio pays the screenwriter for the rights to make that script into a film. Assuming the script actually gets green-lit, the studio spends millions of dollars producing it into an actual film. Whatever profits are generated at the box office, after theaters take a 40% cut, belong entirely to the studio. A superstar screenwriter will only make a couple hundred grand in TOTAL from this process, even from a movie that becomes a blockbuster smash.</p><p>As with most business ventures, whoever takes the most risk receives the biggest reward (and conversely the biggest financial burden if the project is a flop). In the previous scenario, our lowly screenwriter didn't take on any risk. They were paid a fair market rate to perform a service and then sent on their way.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with this strategy. Studios can afford the risk. Screenwriters can not.</p><p>However!</p><p>If you ever find yourself sitting on an screenplay that you're absolutely 100% certain is going to make a fortune, there's another route you can take:</p><p>Bet on yourself.</p><p>Take on some risk by chipping in your own money. That's why <a href=#>George Lucas is billionaire</a>. That's why <a href=#>Mel Gibson earned an enormous fortune</a> from "Passion of the Christ." That's how <a href=#>Todd Phillips earned enough money from "The Hangover"</a> to buy a $10 million Malibu mansion AND a $30 million Beverly Hills mansion.</p><p>A little more than a decade ago <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> was looking to semi-autobiographical movie based on his days dancing as a male stripper in Tampa. Like George, Mel and Todd before him, Channing was absolutely 100% sure his make stripper drama was going to make a fortune. So he bet on himself. And today he sits atop an XXXL "Magic Mike" financial empire.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343842 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/magic-mike.jpg alt width=900 height=622 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343842 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Gregg DeGuire/WireImage)</p><h2><strong>An XXXL Empire Is Born</strong></h2><p>In case you weren't already aware, Channing Tatum did indeed work as a stripper in Tampa after dropping out of college. His stripper name was "Chan Crawford." In 2000, Channing drove to Orlando to audition to be a backup dancer in the <a href=# title="Ricky Martin Net Worth">Ricky Martin</a> music video "She Bangs". He won the part and earned $400. He was an Abercrombie guy, appeared in some commercials and worked mostly a model until 2006 when he landed a starring role opposite <a href=# title="Amanda Bynes Net Worth">Amanda Bynes</a> in the movie "She's The Man." That same year he had his breakout role opposite future wife (now ex-wife) <a href=#>Jenna Dewan</a> in "Step Up." Despite being critically panned, "Step Up" earned a surprising $114 million at the box office on a $12 million budget..</p><p>In 2010 Channing had a role in the <a href=#>Steven Soderberg</a> film "Haywire." A year later, while sitting next to Soderberg answering questions at a press junket for "Haywire", Channing mentioned his desire to adapt his early life as a stripper into a film. Soderberg was intrigued and later agreed to meet Channing for lunch, apparently at a hot dog joint (not sure if that was foreshadowing). At that hot dog lunch, Soderberg agreed to direct the film on one condition:</p><p><span style=color:red><strong>They had to co-finance the $7 million budget with their own money.</strong></span></p><p>Channing agreed.</p><p>"Magic Mike" was released on June 24, 2012. It <a href=#>went on to make $167 million at the box office</a>. It made tens of millions more from home rentals and DVD sales. After all costs were subtracted, Steven and Channing both earned…</p><h2><strong>$60 million</strong></h2><p>They both earned another $30 million when the second film made $122 million on a $15 million budget. For a total pay day of…</p><h2><strong>$90 million, a piece</strong></h2><p>But that's not where this story ends.</p><p>Just a couple days ago a third, and apparently final, film installment titled "Magic Mike's Last Dance" was released in theaters worldwide. This third installment, which was produced with a $50 million production budget, was the highest grossing film at the US box office this weekend, with $8 million in domestic earnings, slightly topping "Avatar: The Way of Water." It earned $18 million globally, just shy of Avatar's $19 million global receipts.</p><p>But once again, that's not where this story ends.</p><p>In addition to the three films, Magic Mike has been franchised into a live act that tours the globe and has a permanent residency in Las Vegas at the Sahara casino. To date, Magic Mike has sold <span style=color:red><strong>$125 MILLION</strong></span> worth of tickets to its various live acts. Let me repeat that:</p><h2><strong>$125 million</strong></h2><p>It's not known how much Channing earns from the live show since its a franchise model where he has licensed the rights to the Sahara likely for a flat annual fee. Considering how much other <a href=#>performers make licensing their IP to Vegas</a>, I wouldn't blush if you told me "Magic Mike" will stuff a few million dollars into Channing's G-string every year, for the rest of his life.</p><p>Not bad for a college dropout former stripper! Goes to show you how powerful betting on yourself can be!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJon6ivXZi1orrNoqWgZaSWwba5jJucrWWfo3qptcysnKWeXZa7pXnTrqmnnZRiuqKzyJxkpqGbmnqqutOoZJqmXa3FubiMn6CnmZ6YtqK4jJ6kqaGimnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./james-nesbitt-stars-in-first-cold-feet-teaser-watch-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;James Nesbitt stars in first Cold Feet teaser: watch now</a>
